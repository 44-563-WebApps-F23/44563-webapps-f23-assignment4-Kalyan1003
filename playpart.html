    <h2>An Enemy of the People by Henrik Ibsen</h2>
    Dr. Stockmann. You will see he won't dare to come.<br>

    <h6>Mrs. Stockmann</h6>. Well, that is just what Randine thought—that he didn't
    dare to, on account of the neighbours. (Calls into the sitting-room.)
    What is it you want, Randine? Give it to me. (Goes in, and comes out
    again directly.) Here is a letter for you, <h6>Thomas</h6>.<br>

    Dr. Stockmann. Let me see it. (Opens and reads it.) Ah!—of course.<br>

    Mrs. Stockmann. Who is it from?<br>

    Dr. Stockmann. From the landlord. Notice to quit.<br>

    Mrs. Stockmann. Is it possible? Such a nice man<br>

    Dr. Stockmann (looking at the letter). Does not dare do otherwise, he
    says. Doesn't like doing it, but dare not do otherwise—on account of
    his fellow-citizens—out of regard for public opinion. Is in a
    dependent position—dares not offend certain influential men.
